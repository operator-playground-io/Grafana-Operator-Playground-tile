title: Prometheus and Grafana monitoring
description: This tutorial explains how Prometheus can be used to monitor the targets/endpoints and check metrics on Grafana dashboard.
---

### Monitoring using Prometheus and Grafana 


Prometheus is designed to monitor the targets including servers, databases, standalone virtual machines, etc.

**Features of Prometheus**
-	Prometheus is a pull-based monitoring system.
-	It actively screens the targets to fetch the corresponding metrics.
-	It periodically scraps the target systems while monitoring.
-	It usually retrieves the metrics via HTTP calls to the endpoints defined in the Prometheus configuration file.

Let’s take the example of MariaDB server and see how Prometheus performs the monitoring. We will also explore the obtained metrics on Grafana dashboard. 
 

### Monitoring MariaDB server using Prometheus

To monitor the MariaDB server using Prometheus, you need to first install the MariaDB operator and MariaDB server instance by following Step 1 and Step 2 as below. 

You can ignore these steps if you already have MariaDB operator installed and have created the MariaDB Server instance.


**Step 1: Install the MariaDB operator by running the following command.**

```execute
kubectl create -f https://operatorhub.io/install/mariadb-operator-app.yaml             
```

 - **After installation, use the following command to verify that your operator has been successfully installed.**


```execute
kubectl get csv -n my-mariadb-operator-app
```
Please wait until the PHASE status is "Succeeded", then proceed.

You will see a similar output as below:

```
NAME                      DISPLAY            VERSION   REPLACES                  PHASE
mariadb-operator.v0.0.4   Mariadb Operator   0.0.4     mariadb-operator.v0.0.3   Succeeded
```

Note: Once operator is successfully installed, Output PHASE should be as "Succeeded".



 - **Check the Pod status using the command below.**


```execute
kubectl get pods -n my-mariadb-operator-app
```

You will see a similar output as below:

```
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mariadb-operator-f96ddc69f-d5vgr   1/1     Running   0          100s
```

Note: In above output, we see the STATUS is "Running" which means that the pods are up and running.


**Step 2: Create MariaDB Server instance and a ` test-db` database along with user details.**

 
  - **Create the below yaml definition of the Custom Resource.**  

```execute
cat <<'EOF' > MariaDBserver.yaml
apiVersion: mariadb.persistentsys/v1alpha1
kind: MariaDB
metadata:
  name: mariadb
spec:
  # Keep this parameter value unchanged.
  size: 1
  
  # Root user password
  rootpwd: password

  # New Database name
  database: test-db
  # Database additional user details (base64 encoded)
  username: db-user 
  password: db-user 

  # Image name with version
  image: "mariadb/server:10.3"

  # Database storage Path
  dataStoragePath: "/mnt/data" 

  # Database storage Size (Ex. 1Gi, 100Mi)
  dataStorageSize: "1Gi"

  # Port number exposed for Database service
  port: 30685
EOF
```

 - **Execute below command to create an instance of MariaDBserver using the above yaml definition:**

```execute
kubectl create -f MariaDBserver.yaml -n my-mariadb-operator-app 
```

Output:

```
mariadb.mariadb.persistentsys/mariadb created
```

 - **Check the Pods status.**

```execute
kubectl get pods -n my-mariadb-operator-app
```

- **Wait until the STATUS of Pods is "Running".**

You will see a similar output as below:

```
NAME                               READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mariadb-operator-f96ddc69f-l44r4   1/1     Running   0          10m
mariadb-server-5dccfb7b59-rwzqp    1/1     Running   0          10m
```


**Step 3 : Access MariaDB Database.** 

- Connect to the MariaDB Server Pod.

 - Copy the command below to the terminal, and add the podname of MariaDB Server Instance.
    
```copycommand
 kubectl exec -it <podname> bash -n my-mariadb-operator-app
 ```


 - Connect to the database using username **db-user** and password **db-user**


 ```execute
 mysql -h ##DNS.ip## -P 30685 -u db-user -pdb-user
 ```


- List the database

```execute
show databases;
```


- Exit the database.


```execute
exit
```


- Use the command below to login as root user.


```execute
mysql -h ##DNS.ip## -P 30685 -u root -ppassword
```

- Create the ‘testdb’ database.

```execute
create database testdb;
```


- Use the testdb to create a table 

```execute
use testdb;
```


- Create a table 

```execute
create table Population(year numeric,population numeric);
```

- Insert the data values into the table so you can check MariaDB mySQL metrics from Grafana dashboard.

```execute
insert into Population values(2017,1380004385 );
```

```execute
insert into Population values(2018,1366417754 );
```

```execute
insert into Population values(2019,1352642280 );
```

```execute
insert into Population values(2020,1338676785 );
```


- Retrieve the data from table

```execute
select * from Population;
```

- Exit from testdb :

```execute
exit
```

- Exit from Pod :

```execute
exit
```


**Step 4: Enable monitoring service for MariaDB Server.**


 - **Find the services of MariaDB using below command.**
  
  ```execute
  kubectl get svc -n my-mariadb-operator-app
  ```

 You will see a similar output as below:
 
 ```
      NAME                       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)             AGE
 mariadb-operator-metrics   ClusterIP   10.111.158.91    <none>        8383/TCP,8686/TCP   3d4h
 mariadb-service            NodePort    10.106.178.202   <none>        80:30685/TCP        3d4h
 ```
 
- **Get the port of mariadb-service.**
  
  From above command output, mariadb-service port is `30685`. 

- **Create the below yaml definition of the Custom Resource to enable monitoring using Prometheus exporter pod and service.**

```execute
cat <<'EOF'> MariaDBmonitoring.yaml
apiVersion: mariadb.persistentsys/v1alpha1
kind: Monitor
metadata:
  name: mariadb-monitor
spec:
  # Add fields here
  size: 1
  # Database source to connect with for colleting metrics
  # Format: "<db-user>:<db-password>@(<dbhost>:<dbport>)/<dbname>">
  # Make approprite changes 
  dataSourceName: "root:password@(##DNS.ip##:30685)/test-db"
  # Image name with version
  # Refer https://registry.hub.docker.com/r/prom/mysqld-exporter for more details
  image: "prom/mysqld-exporter"
EOFExecute below command to create an instance of MariaDBserver using the above yaml definition
```

Note: The database host and port should be correct for metrics to work. Host will be IP of the Cluster and the port will be mariadb-service port(see Step 4).


- **Execute below command to create an instance of Monitoring using the above yaml definition.** 

```execute
kubectl create -f MariaDBmonitoring.yaml -n my-mariadb-operator-app
```

Output:

```
monitor.mariadb.persistentsys/mariadb-monitor created
```

This will start Prometheus exporter pod and service. 



- **Check the Pods status.**


```execute
kubectl get pods -n my-mariadb-operator-app
```

You will see a similar output as below:

```
NAME                                          READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
mariadb-monitor-deployment-7dd85cfbbd-kbbjb   1/1     Running   0          9s
mariadb-operator-f96ddc69f-l44r4              1/1     Running   0          16m
mariadb-server-5dccfb7b59-rwzqp               1/1     Running   0          16m
```


### Install Prometheus Operator and Create Instance of Prometheus Server and ServiceMonitor

Note: Ignore below step (Step 5) if you have already installed Prometheus operator and created the instance of Prometheus Server and ServiceMonitor.

**Step 5: Install the Prometheus operator by running the following command.**

```execute
kubectl create -f https://operatorhub.io/install/prometheus.yaml
```

Output:

```
subscription.operators.coreos.com/my-prometheus created
```

Note: This Operator will be installed in the "operators" namespace and will be usable from all namespaces in the cluster.


- Execute below command to verify that your operator has been installed successfully.

```execute
kubectl get csv -n operators
```

You will see a similar output as below:

```
NAME                        DISPLAY               VERSION   REPLACES                    PHASE
prometheusoperator.0.37.0   Prometheus Operator   0.37.0    prometheusoperator.0.32.0   Succeeded
```

Note: Please wait for the PHASE status to be "Succeeded", then proceed.
In the above output, PHASE status "Succeeded" shows that the operator has been successfully installed.


- Check the Pods status using below command.

```execute
kubectl get pods -n operators
```

You will see a similar output as below:

```
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
prometheus-operator-6f7589ff7f-wq9zd   1/1     Running   0          8m35s
```

In above output, STATUS as "Running" shows the pods are up and running.


Note:If you are installing from operatorhub, then by default it installs the operator in the operators namespace. Below steps assume that it’s deployed in the operators namespace.



- Create the below yaml definition of the Custom Resource to create a Prometheus Instance along with a ServiceAccount and a Service of type NodePort 


```execute
cat <<'EOF' > prometheusInstance.yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: Prometheus
metadata:
  name: server
  labels:
    prometheus: k8s
  namespace: operators
spec:
  replicas: 1
  serviceAccountName: prometheus-k8s
  securityContext: {}
  serviceMonitorSelector:
    matchLabels:
      app: playground  
  alerting:
    alertmanagers:
      - namespace: operators
        name: alertmanager-main
        port: web  
EOF
```


- Execute below command to create Prometheus instance.



```execute
kubectl create -f prometheusInstance.yaml -n operators
```

Output:

```
prometheus.monitoring.coreos.com/server created
```

- Get the associated Pods.

```execute
kubectl get pods -n operators
```

You will see a similar output as below:

```
NAME                                   READY   STATUS    RESTARTS   AGE
prometheus-operator-6f7589ff7f-wq9zd   1/1     Running   0          14m
prometheus-server-0                    3/3     Running   1          40s
```

Note: Wait until the STATUS of Pods is "Running".


- Create below yaml definition of the custom resource to create the service NodePort to access prometheus server.


```execute
cat <<'EOF' > prometheus_service.yaml
apiVersion: v1
kind: Service
metadata:
  name: prometheus
spec:
  type: NodePort
  ports:
  - name: web
    nodePort: 30100
    port: 9090
    protocol: TCP
    targetPort: web
  selector:
    app: prometheus
EOF
```

- Execute below command to create Prometheus Service.

```execute
kubectl create -f prometheus_service.yaml -n operators
```

Output:

```
service/prometheus created
```


- Create below yaml definition of the Custom Resource to create Instance of ServiceMonitor.


```execute
cat <<'EOF' > ServiceMonitor.yaml
apiVersion: monitoring.coreos.com/v1
kind: ServiceMonitor
metadata:
  name: mariadb-monitor 
  labels:
    app: playground
  namespace: operators
spec:
  namespaceSelector:
    any: true
  selector:
    matchLabels:
      tier: monitor-app 
  endpoints:
   - interval: 20s
     port: monitor    
EOF
```


- Execute below command to create an instance of ServiceMonitor.


```execute
kubectl create -f ServiceMonitor.yaml -n operators
```

Output:

```
servicemonitor.monitoring.coreos.com/mariadb-monitor created
```


- Get the associated Pods.

```execute
kubectl get pods -n operators
```

You will see a similar output as below:

```

### Install Grafana Operator and create Grafana Instance and Grafana Service of type NodePort 

Note: If you have already installed Grafana Operator and have created Grafana Instance and Service, you can skip below Step(Step 7).If not,proceed with below step.

**Step 7 : Install the Grafana Operator and create Grafana Instance.** 

Use the `Install` button of Grafana Tutorial to install the Grafana Operator and "Grafana Instance Creation" tutorial to create Grafana Instance.


**Step 8: Create the below yaml definition of the custom resource to create Instance of Grafana Datasource.**

```execute
cat <<'EOF' > prometheus-datasources.yaml
apiVersion: integreatly.org/v1alpha1
kind: GrafanaDataSource
metadata:
  name: prometheus-grafanadatasource
spec:
  datasources:
    - access: proxy
      editable: true
      isDefault: true
      jsonData:
        timeInterval: 5s
      name: Prometheus
      type: prometheus
      url: 'http://prometheus-operated.operators:9090'
      version: 1
  name: prometheus-datasources.yaml  
EOF
```

Here we are choosing Prometheus as our Datasource.


- **Execute below command to create an instance of Grafana Datasource using the above yaml definition.**


```execute
kubectl create -f prometheus-datasources.yaml -n my-grafana-operator
```

Output:

```
grafanadatasource.integreatly.org/prometheus-grafanadatasource created
```

**Step 9: Access and Configure Grafana dashboard via Grafana UI.**


  -**Find all the services in "my-grafana-operator" namespace using below command.**


```execute
kubectl get svc -n my-grafana-operator
```

You will see a similar output as below:


```
NAME                       TYPE        CLUSTER-IP       EXTERNAL-IP   PORT(S)          AGE
grafana-operator-metrics   ClusterIP   10.96.188.27     <none>        8080/TCP         83s
grafana-service            ClusterIP   10.105.85.60     <none>        3000/TCP         47s
grafana-svc                NodePort    10.109.242.171   <none>        3000:30200/TCP   7s
```

From above, we can see the output `grafana-svc` NodePort is `30200`.


Click on http://##DNS.ip##:30200 to access your Grafana dashboard.


The Grafana page will load as shown below.
